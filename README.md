# LC-3-VM
A simple virtual machine based on the [Little Computer 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Computer_3) architecture. I used [this excellent tutorial by Justin Meiners and Ryan Pendleton](https://www.jmeiners.com/lc3-vm/) as a guide. If you are interested in learning about virtual machines I recommend you to have a look at it. It is a great introductory resource to the subject!
