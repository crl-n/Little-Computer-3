# Little Computer 3
A simple virtual machine based on the [Little Computer 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Computer_3) architecture. I used [this excellent tutorial by Justin Meiners and Ryan Pendleton](https://www.jmeiners.com/lc3-vm/) as a guide. If you are interested in learning about virtual machines I recommend you to have a look at it. It is a great introductory resource to the subject.

### Usage
Simply clone the repository and use Make to build the project. The binary takes as an argument the path to the image file that is to be run. Image files need to be written for the LC-3 architecture.
```
lc3 [path to image file]
```
Here are couple LC-3 programs you may use for testing:<br>
